# GOMOKU

###### The Gomoku is an AI project where we had to make an AI fighting against other AIs or humans on the gomoku game.
[Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is a very well known game, where you have to align horizontally, veritcally, or diagonally 5 coins, you can play in multiplayer or against an AI.

First thing first, you need, to download Piskvork to play with our AI and others that you have created or against yourself.

Here is the communication protocol : https://svn.code.sf.net/p/piskvork/code/trunk/source/doc/protocl2en.htm

To download Piskvork : http://gomocup.org/download-gomocup-manager/

### Program compilation and launching:
  ##### Windows:
  ```sh
        cmake
```
  > Will compile the entire project and generate a Visual Studio solution.

  > Now that you have a visual studio solution, just launch it with visual studio, it will build a ***.exe***
  
  > Use that executable with Piskvork.
